Hey! o/ I'm glad you stopped by. This repo contains config files and some code,
especially in shell script, that I don't mind leaving in the public domain.
Yop, you can do *anything* with these files, post them in your own github repo,
make money out of them, even claim you created them yourself :D, that's what
the [license](UNLICENSE) grants you.

Legally, you don't have to credit me, I can't summon the [Leviathan][1] (the
State) to force you to, but out of good manners, good practice and Scientific
Spirit I ask you cite your sources; it'll help future you remember where you
found them and make it easier to update, as *these files can change*. A link to
this repo is enough.

"why are you doing this? does this have a virus somewhere? I... I.. I just can't
believe people would work for free"

Well if it has a virus, then I infect my own computer with it everyday. I do
this because I think it's nice and I wish people did this too, so I might aswell
set the example. Also eh.. It's not _really_ for free, it adds to my portfolio
and soon [greedy villain voice] y'all be able to give me money heheh (I'll
setup a donate link, you won't really have to pay me though).
