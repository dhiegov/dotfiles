Hey! o/ I'm glad you stopped by. This repo contains config files and some code,
especially in shell script, that I don't mind leaving in the public domain.
Yop, you can do *anything* with these files, such as post them in your own
github repo, make money out of them, even claim you created them yourself :D,
that's what the [license](UNLICENSE) grants you.

Legally, you don't have to credit me, I can't summon the [Leviathan][1] (the
State) to force you to, but out of good manners, good practice and Scientific
Spirit I ask you cite your sources; it'll help future you remember where you
found them and make it easier to update, as *these files can change*. A link to
this repo is enough.

> Why are you doing this? I can't believe people would not want to be credited

I want to be credited, I'm just not forcing you to do it. I do this because I
think it's nice and I wish people did this too, so I might aswell set the
example. Also eh.. It's not _really_ for free, it adds to my portfolio and soon
[greedy villain voice] y'all be able to give me money heheh (I'll setup a
donate link, you won't really have to pay me though).

Beyond that, it wouldn't make sense for me to prosecute someone for using the
same set of options that I used, as option names and values in most cases are
predefined fixed strings. Why would I use a more restrictive license if I won't
be enforcing it? At that point its only purpose is to inform the author's
whishes to get credit, unauthorize commercial use, etc.
