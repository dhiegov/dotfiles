Hey! o/ I'm glad you stopped by. This repo contains config files and some code,
especially in shell script, that I don't mind leaving in the public domain.
Yop, you can do *anything* with these files, post them in your own github repo,
make money out of them, even claim you created them yourself :D, that's what
the [license](UNLICENSE) grants you.

Legally, you don't have to credit me, I can't summon the [Leviathan][1] (the
State) to force you to, but out of good manners, good practice and Scientific
Spirit I ask you cite your sources; it'll help future you remember where you
found them and make it easier to update, as *these files can change*. A link to
this repo is enough.
